 Robot navigation projects using ROS and Gazebo! I have also included visual demos generated using odometry data from the robots.
 
 
SLAM:

SLAM is the process by which a robot or a device can build a map of an unknown environment while also locating its own position within that environment using various sensors. In this case, the turtlebot uses LiDAR proximity sensors.
The main objective of this program was to generate a complete map of the arena by autonomously moving the robot through it.

Basic controls:

This is a simple program to have the robot follow a pre-determined path. There is no obstacle avoidance, but the robot is programmed to correct itself if it deviates from its designated path.
